# Your assignments

You can form groups of 2-3 and split the work amongst yourself.

Create a program that implements a doubly linked list in C++. The entire assignment should be build using `cmake` based build and test systems. Expectations are as follows:

- You should publish the API in a separate header file
- The results should be published in a separate header file
- Your implementation should be tested using [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main). This [Sample](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/b2b9072ecbe874f5937054653ef8f2731eb0f010/googletest/samples/sample5_unittest.cc) shows how to go about it
- The unit test should be integrated with the build system using `cmake`

Final results should be published on github. Bonus points for those who can integrate their build system with [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

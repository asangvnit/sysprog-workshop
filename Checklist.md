## Introduction

For a successful conduct of an event, it is important that the venue where the
workshop is conducted meets certain requirements. Following sections describe
the preparations ACM expects from the organizers.

## Venue Selection

The workshop involves theory as well as lab section. In case the students carry
their own laptops with all the [prerequisites](Setup.md), the lab session can
be done in the same venue. However, most presentation halls do no have power
outlets for students. Organizers can select the venue considering their own
practical constraints.

## Audio Visual

The speaker/presenter should be provided with a collar microphone. In addition,
a podium to keep the speaker's laptop should be available. A podium microphone
is generally a good idea. A good quality LCD projector with good intensity to
ensure that participants and follow the prensetation is equally important. The
projector cable should be HDMI so that it can be connected to the speaker's
laptop's HDMI-Out port. Speaker's laptop should be connected to the projector
directly from the podium. If the cable is not long enough, an extension cable
should be made available.

## AC Power for Speaker's Laptop

Laptop's normally have sufficient battery life to last the duration of the
presentation. However, the power management may kick-in if it is not connected
to the AC power.

## Network Equipment Hookup

ACM Speakers would bring in their own router and Wifi access point. So two AC
power slots should be made available to them. 1 Gbps wired uplink connection to
the college backbone network would be required for the router to function. If
the presentation hall has its own Wifi infrastructure, it may interfere with
ACM Wifi AP. So that should be powered off for the duration of the seminar.

Once the ACM network equipments are plugged in, workshop pariticipants would be
able to connect to ACM Wifi directly.

## Miscellaneous Requirements

- Laser pointer with new batteries
- [PPT Remote Presenter](https://www.amazon.in/rts-2019-2020-Presenter-Powerpoint-Controller/dp/B07XZJ93MG/)
- Small water bottles for the speakers

# Introduction to docker
- Haven't heard of [docker](https://docker.com/)? We you sleeping under a rock?
- Official definition is not very useful
 > Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
- Its a platform for developing and deploying applications in *containers*
  - Provides isolation - network, filesystem, resources
  - Sandbox environment that doesn't change
  - Testing on different envrionments/operating system
- *Much more efficient* than full Virtualization. Uses the same kernel as host operating system (on linux)
- Easy to use - GUI as well as CLI interface
